## Introduction

##  Project 1 - MrBeast Analysis with Dashboard 

Programing Language / Software - Python, Power BI \
Python Library - Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, nltk,  strings

Sumnmary of the project: This project features a comprehensive analysis dashboard for MrBeast's content. The dashboard, implemented in Power Bi , provides insights into various aspects of MrBeast's videos, engagement metrics, and more. The data is extracted from the YouTube API, and Python is utilized for data wrangling, leveraging the powerful `pandas` library.

The analysis includes statistical insights using the `stats` library, data visualization using `seaborn`, and machine learning utilizing `scikit-learn`. These tools collectively contribute to a thorough exploration and understanding of MrBeast's content landscape.

Additionally, for data cleaning and NLP tasks, the project uses the `nltk` and `strings` libraries. This includes removing stopwords, tokenization, lemmatization, and conducting sentiment analysis in the comment sections. Redundant data, such as non-English words, is filtered out to enhance the quality of the analysis.

The dashboard boasts a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to explore and interpret the data. Additionally, for enhanced interactivity and visualization, **Power BI** is integrated to create an engaging and insightful dashboard.
