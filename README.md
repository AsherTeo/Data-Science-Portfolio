Python Library - **googleapiclient, numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, nltk,  strings**

**Summary of the project**:

This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing MrBeast's YouTube content, with insights into various engagement metrics extracted from the YouTube API and processed using Python's pandas library. It includes statistical insights via the stats library, data visualization with seaborn, and machine learning using scikit-learn, along with data cleaning and NLP tasks performed by nltk and strings libraries. The user-friendly interface of the Power BI dashboard facilitates easy exploration and interpretation of the data, enhancing interactivity and visualization.

##  [Project 2 - Lottery-Data-Analytics](https://github.com/AsherTeo/Lottery-Data-Analytics)

Programing Language / Software - **Python, Power BI** \
Python Library - **numpy, pandas, selenium, seaborn, scipy **

**Summary of the project**:

Welcome to the Toto lottery data analysis project, which focuses on uncovering patterns and trends in the Toto draws from Singapore. By extracting data from the official Singapore Pools website using Selenium, we preprocess and analyze it with Python libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn to identify 'hot' and 'cold' numbers, and explore the frequency of number reappearances in subsequent draws. Statistical tests using scipy, along with an interactive Power BI dashboard, provide engaging and dynamic visualizations, allowing users to explore insights and trends in the Toto data in a casino-like experience.
