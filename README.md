## Introduction

##  [Project 1 - MrBeast Analysis with Dashboard](https://github.com/AsherTeo/MR-Beast-Data-Analytics)

Programing Language / Software - **Python, Power BI** \
Python Library - **numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, googleapiclient, scikit-learn, nltk,  strings**

**Summary of the project**:

This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing MrBeast's YouTube content, with insights into various engagement metrics extracted from the YouTube API and processed using Python's pandas library. It includes statistical insights via the stats library, data visualization with seaborn, and machine learning using scikit-learn, along with data cleaning and NLP tasks performed by nltk and strings libraries. The user-friendly interface of the Power BI dashboard facilitates easy exploration and interpretation of the data, enhancing interactivity and visualization.

##  [Project 2 - Lottery-Data-Analytics](https://github.com/AsherTeo/Lottery-Data-Analytics)

Programing Language / Software - **Python, Power BI** \
Python Library - **numpy, pandas, selenium, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy**

**Summary of the project**:

Welcome to the Toto lottery data analysis project, which focuses on uncovering patterns and trends in the Toto draws from Singapore. By extracting data from the official Singapore Pools website using Selenium, we preprocess and analyze it with Python libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn to identify 'hot' and 'cold' numbers, and explore the frequency of number reappearances in subsequent draws. Statistical tests using scipy, along with an interactive Power BI dashboard, provide engaging and dynamic visualizations, allowing users to explore insights and trends in the Toto data in a casino-like experience.

##  [Project 3 - Financial-Loan-Analytics](https://github.com/AsherTeo/Financial-Loan-Analytics)

Programing Language / Software - **SQL, Python, Power BI** \
Python Library - **numpy, pandas, pyodbc, selenium, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy,  scikit-learn, optuna. gradio**

**Summary of the project**:

For this project, we analyze a financial loan dataset to identify key contributors to profitability and examine the impact of variables like interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and annual income, using SQL for data extraction and Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn for analysis and visualization, complemented by interactive Power BI dashboards. We train and optimize an XGBoost model for binary classification of loan status, where 'Current' and 'Fully Paid' are labeled as '1' and 'Charged Off' as '0', streamlining the prediction process with a Gradio-powered machine learning GUI.
