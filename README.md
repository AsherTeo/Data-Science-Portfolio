## Introduction

Hi, I am Asher, a passionate data scientist and analyst with a keen interest in uncovering insights from complex datasets. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Power BI, I strive to translate data into actionable insights and compelling narratives. Below, you'll find a selection of my projects that showcase my skills in data extraction, analysis, machine learning, and interactive dashboard creation.

##  [Project 1 - MrBeast Analysis with Dashboard](https://github.com/AsherTeo/MR-Beast-Data-Analytics)

Programing Language / Software - **Python, Power BI** \
Python Library - **numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, googleapiclient, scikit-learn, nltk,  strings**

**Summary of the project**:

This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing MrBeast's YouTube content, with insights into various engagement metrics extracted from the YouTube API and processed using Python's pandas library. It includes statistical insights via the stats library, data visualization with seaborn, and machine learning using scikit-learn, along with data cleaning and NLP tasks performed by nltk and strings libraries. The user-friendly interface of the Power BI dashboard facilitates easy exploration and interpretation of the data, enhancing interactivity and visualization.

##  [Project 2 - Lottery-Data-Analytics](https://github.com/AsherTeo/Lottery-Data-Analytics)

Programing Language / Software - **Python, Power BI** \
Python Library - **numpy, pandas, selenium, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy**

**Summary of the project**:

Welcome to the Toto lottery data analysis project, which focuses on uncovering patterns and trends in the Toto draws from Singapore. By extracting data from the official Singapore Pools website using Selenium, we preprocess and analyze it with Python libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn to identify 'hot' and 'cold' numbers, and explore the frequency of number reappearances in subsequent draws. Statistical tests using scipy, along with an interactive Power BI dashboard, provide engaging and dynamic visualizations, allowing users to explore insights and trends in the Toto data in a casino-like experience.

##  [Project 3 - Financial-Loan-Analytics](https://github.com/AsherTeo/Financial-Loan-Analytics)

Programing Language / Software - **SQL, Python, Power BI** \
Python Library - **numpy, pandas, pyodbc, selenium, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy,  scikit-learn, optuna, gradio**

**Summary of the project**:

For this project, we analyze a financial loan dataset to identify key contributors to profitability and examine the impact of variables like interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and annual income, using SQL for data extraction and Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn for analysis and visualization, complemented by interactive Power BI dashboards. We train and optimize an XGBoost model for binary classification of loan status, where 'Current' and 'Fully Paid' are labeled as '1' and 'Charged Off' as '0', streamlining the prediction process with a Gradio-powered machine learning GUI.

##  [Project 4 - Tesla-Stock-Predicition](https://github.com/AsherTeo/Tesla-Stock-Predicition)

Programing Language / Software - **Python** \
Python Library - **numpy, pandas, yfinance, TensorFlow, statsmodels , matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn,  optuna**

**Summary of the project**:

In this project, we analyzed Tesla stock data from January 1, 2019, to April 29, 2024, using the yfinance library, focusing on the 'Close' column, and conducted a Technical Analysis with indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify trends and patterns. We employed various time series models, including ARIMA, LSTM, and Transformer, using TensorFlow for forecasting, fine-tuning with Optuna, and experimenting with machine learning techniques such as linear regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Finally, we compared the results using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE to evaluate the performance of each algorithm in time series forecasting.

##  [Project 5 - Building-a-Mobile-Specification-Classifier-Using-Azure-ML-SDK-AutoML]([https://github.com/AsherTeo/Tesla-Stock-Predicition](https://github.com/AsherTeo/Building-a-Mobile-Specification-Classifier-Using-Azure-ML-SDK-AutoML))
